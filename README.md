Overview
This project is a React application that uses Redux for state management. It provides a modern and responsive user interface with a centralized state management solution, allowing for scalable and maintainable code.

Features
React: Efficient, declarative, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Redux: Predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
React-Redux: Official React bindings for Redux.
Thunk Middleware: For handling asynchronous actions in Redux.
Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Clone the Repository

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/react-redux-project.git
cd react-redux-project
Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the Development Server
bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will be running at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Usage
Basic Structure
src/: Contains the main application code.
components/: Reusable React components.
containers/: Components connected to Redux.
actions/: Action creators for Redux.
reducers/: Redux reducers for managing state.
store/: Configuration for the Redux store.
App.js: Main application component.
index.js: Entry point for the application.
Example Component
Here’s a basic example of a connected component:

javascript
Copy code
// src/containers/Counter.js
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { increment, decrement } from '../actions';

const Counter = ({ count, increment, decrement }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
    <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
  </div>
);

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  count: state.counter
});

const mapDispatchToProps = {
  increment,
  decrement
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
Redux Setup
Actions: Define action types and creators in src/actions/.
Reducers: Manage state updates in src/reducers/.
Store: Create and configure the Redux store in src/store/.
API Reference
Actions
increment(): Action creator to increment the counter.
decrement(): Action creator to decrement the counter.
Reducers
counterReducer(state, action): Reducer to handle counter state changes.
Store
configureStore(): Configures the Redux store with middleware and reducers.
